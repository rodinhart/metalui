- update docs + examples!
- scrolling while editing
  - virtual scrolling, when scrolling or even scrolling offscreen will edit "state" be remembered?
- previous state management, like anchor
  - state related to last action
- background search
  - CSP - search is now process
    - needs to let caller know when done
    - needs to know when to cancel/reset search
- tests!
- fix react-bridge
- forms (9. Forms)

  - rerendering at wrong level
  - do we need controlled components?
    - pro would be disallowing certain characters in input
      - can be done with preventDefault onkeypress
    - or putting thousands separators in while typing

- await notify?
  - because components are async, and cannot send signal back, you can't tell whether components is alive but pending, or dead
  - hence you can't know whether to notify is done or not
- put warning/errors where sensible
- Live code sandbox?
- react bridge: allow () => <div>Hello</div> components?
- Çƒ (special char)
- a event wrapper library for cross browser compatibility?
- global progress veil/bar, can it be done
