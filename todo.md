- react useContext example
  - can we make context non-global?
  - $ means context
  - document this
- escape strings to prevent injection attacks
- test/implement component "dismount" after `for await of`
- allow preventDefault on events
  - should already work
  - a event wrapper library for cross browser compatibility?
- forms (9. Forms)
- await notify?
- properly fix types for markup etc
